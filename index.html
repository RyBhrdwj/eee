    <h2>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>BRANCH UPGRADATION</h4>
            <p>Branch upgradation depends on number of vacant seats left in the desired branch.
                Minimum target to get branch upgradation is 9.0 GPA in both the semesters. <br>
                Since it is undecided whether the marks of only the 1<sup>st</sup> Sem will be considered or of 1<sup>st</sup> Year.
                <br> Upgradation to ECE is relatively easier compared to CSE/IT.
            </p>

            <h4>MUST REVISE TOPICS FROM 11<sup>th</sup>/12<sup>th</sup></h4>
            <p>These topics serve as foundation for chapters in harder subjects like AM, AP, ES etc. <br>
                Without having a grasp on these topics, it's difficult to understand what's being taught in the classes.
                A list for these topics is given below :
                <ul>
                    <li>Differentiation, Integration</li>
                    <li>Vector</li>
                    <li>Matrices</li>
                    <li>Laws and Formulas covered in Electromagnetism</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>CCA/MENTORSHIP/LIBRARY ?</h4>
            <p>These periods are dedicated for Co-Curricular activities and NO ATTENDANCE is taken. <br>
                These periods are treated as free periods and Saturday is treated as an OFF DAY.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>ATTENDANCE</h4>
            <p>Depends from teacher to teacher and while BPIT isn't strict about attendance,
                it is advisable to maintain 75% attendance in the first year. <br>
                So as to avoid backlog, get full marks for attendance and study as much as possible in college itself.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>EXAMS</h4>
            <p>Mid Sem will be conducted roughly around first week of January.<br>
